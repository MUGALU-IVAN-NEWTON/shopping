        <p>Hey how are you doing</p>
    <p>Well I had a long day with my friends and one of them called Mike told us his story.</p>
    <p>So Mike finished S.6 and was pursuing his Engineering course at Makerere University.So he decided to get a hostel in Kikoni and he was able to get a room mate but luckily she was a female called Jane.
    <p>Mike's parents asked him whether he had found a good hostel and ofcourse he told them everything and also about the female room mate. Mike told his parents that there was nothing going on between them and she had her own bed because she's like a sister to him . Mike tried to convince his parents and they didn't mind it.</p>
    <p>After 7 months Mike's mom told him that she was coming to visit them at hostel and they both had no problem with it.</p>
    <p>It was a Saturday morning and Mike's mom was already at the door. They were very happy to receive her and they had a good time. Mike's mom inspected both their rooms and found nothing suspicious because Jane told her that she had a boyfriend and Mike is like a brother to her.</p>
    <P>Mike's mom left in the evening. The following morning Jane was cooking Breakfast and noticed that some plates they always use were missing. So she asked Mike but he didn't know where the plates were.</P>
    <p>Jane told Mike to try asking his mom but he was so annoyed and blamed Jane for calling his mom a thief. Well Jane apologised and they bought new plates.</p>
    <p>After 8 days, Mike took a bold step and decided to call his mom and asked her about the plates. His mom laughed her head off and Mike was inquisitive so he asked her why the laughter.</p>
    <p>His mom told him that she had hidden the plates under Jane's bedcover so if they had not seen them that means they were sleeping together on one bed.</p>
    <p>And it was at that moment that he knew he had fucked up everything.</p>
